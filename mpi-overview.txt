= MPIGAP Overview

MPIGAP is the library for GAP which supports distributed-memory
systems. It is based on MPI communication library, and in its base is
the ParGAP package. MPIGAP and supports distributed-memory programming
on different levels, from low-level MPI bindings, to the high-level
operations with implicit task management and load-balancing.

Prerequisites for installing MPIGAP are:

1. Working MPI library, with {|mpicc|} compiler, and {|MPIHOME|}
environment variable set to the root directory of the library
({|mpicc|} needs to be in {|$(MPIHOME)/bin|}. MPIGAP was tested using
MPICH 3 MPI library (www.mpich.org), but should work also with
OpenMPI.

2. GAP IO package, if IO Pickling is used for object marshalling. See
below

Once the prerequisites are satisfied, you can install MPIGAP by
checking out the latest hpcgap repository and then, from
the GAP root directory, doing

| ./make.hpc mpi

Once MPIGAP is build, you can run it with

| mpiexec -n <noProcesses> bin/<arch>/gap

Probably the best way to run MPIGAP programs is in batch mode. To run
your inputFile.g in this way, do

| mpiexec -n <noProcesses> bin/<arch>/gap inputFile.g
