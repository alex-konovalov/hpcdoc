= MPIGAP Overview

MPIGAP is the library for GAP which supports distributed-memory
systems. It is based on MPI communication library, and in its base is
the ParGAP package. MPIGAP and supports distributed-memory programming
on different levels, from low-level MPI bindings, to the high-level
operations with implicit task management and load-balancing.

To install MPIGAP, checkout the latest hpcgap repository and then from
the GAP root directory do

| ./make.hpc mpi

This requires you to have a working MPI library implementation (such
as MPICH or OpenMPI), and MPIHOME shell variable set to the root dir
of this implementation. 
Once MPIGAP is build, you can run it with

| mpiexec -n <noProcesses> bin/<arch>/gap
